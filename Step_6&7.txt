Task #6: Determine if any Ping packets were dropped after you shutdown the Gig 1/0/1 interface on DSW1.

Gp back to the PC command prompt and check to see if there were any Request Timed Out messages

Next hit ctrl-C to stop the continuous ping in the CMD prompt. 

This takes us to step 7 (Task #7: Do a Trace Route from the PC to the "Internet" address of 1.1.1.1, and notice which gateway it's using to get out to the Internet.)

still in the CMD prompt type:

tracert 1.1.1.1

This should be your output:

 1   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.1.1.3
  2   0 ms      0 ms      1 ms      1.1.1.1

Your Active HSRP is down so the route has switched to your standby HSRP on DSW2 10.1.1.3
